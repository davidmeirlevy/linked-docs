# Linked Docs

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/davidmeirlevy/linked-docs

This library was meant to create tools for documentations written in vitepress / vuepress, to make them more friendly and make it easier for readers to find their solutions faster.

### [Linked Items](./linked-items)
The first component is the [Linked Items](./linked-items) that aims to help the readers to navigate to the page they actually need without reading the whole documentation.

### [Presentation Page](./presentation-page)
The second component is the [Presentation Page](./presentation-page) that aims to create a slides presentation from a page's content.
